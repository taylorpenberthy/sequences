## Sequences

## About

Sequences, built using ReactJS and Django, allows scientists to upload, visualize, and validate DNA sequences.  The application enables users to view existing DNA sequences in a table format, add sequences using a form, and view full DNA sequences with color coding.  When a user enters a new sequence,the sequence must only include the letters A, C, T, or G (the 4 DNA letters), and it cannot already exist in the sequence storage.  Additionally, DNA sequences can be imported via the "Upload" button, as well as exported using the "Download" button.  The "Download" button will give the user a json file of the sequences stored in the table.
